# Longest-Common-Subsequence-C-

# Assumptions:
- The input file is a small plain text file; no need to handle binary files.
- Each input will have a mximum of 4 strings or 4 lines in the input file.
- A string can have a maximum of 1000 characters
- An input file can contain empty lines that should be ignored.
- Characters are case sensitive.

# Notes
- The 9 "input1x.txt" files are the 9 input files that were used to test this code
- The 9 "output1x.txt" files are the files outputted by the program.
- THe 9 "ans1x.txt" files are files containing the correct output that should occur from each corresponding input file, and are available      for comparison to the outputs files to ensure correct output. 
- This code was tested on the University of Houston's Linux server and passed all the test cases.
- The "ArgumentManager.h" file parses arguments to sequentially open the 9 input files to automatically test the code on the server.
